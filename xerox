** shadcn ui== it enables us to build our app by providing us predesigned components which we can copy and paste inside of our project
because this library is build o ntop off tailwind so we have to install or say config tailwind in our project 

we have usedd carousel , button accordion , drawer ,button , card, radio and many more by command // npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion...

for dark mode i again used the shadcn dark componetn where i had the theme-provider component and used that in my project components file and all set

<SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut> if user is signed out then then it will take to the signin 


      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />in this if gthe user is signed in then it will show the userbutton and 
        for all this we dont need to create anything everything is already presnet out htere
      </SignedIn>

*** now see user authentication is done throughly no needd t write the code manually
