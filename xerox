npm i becos to installl all the dependencies that are in the package .json so that r app can run 

** shadcn ui== it enables us to build our app by providing us predesigned components which we can copy and paste inside of our project
because this library is build o ntop off tailwind so we have to install or say config tailwind in our project 

we have usedd carousel , button accordion , drawer ,button , card, radio and many more by command // npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion...

for dark mode i again used the shadcn dark componetn where i had the theme-provider component and used that in my project components file and all set

**background is made using the grid , and then color is given them using chatgpt

supabase setup - where there will be our databse

then clerk= for the user management , it is a libarary that i have setup to ease up my work 

<SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut> if user is signed out then then it will take to the signin 


      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />in this if gthe user is signed in then it will show the userbutton and 
        for all this we dont need to create anything everything is already presnet out htere
      </SignedIn>

*** now see user authentication is done throughly no needd t write the code manually
now it has alll the functoinlaities of delete the user and more and i can even add to it bu changign the items in clerk app

so now we have supabase as our database adn clerk as the user authentication
and then we connected the clerk with the supabase , using the jwt token
